# About
The **SDM Events Lab** mod will allow you to create your own *global* and *local* events. <br>

- **global** events are events that occur for all players on the server <br>
- **local** events are events that occur only for the player <br>

The mod only supports **KubeJS** so far for writing events. <br>
Everything written should be placed in **"kubejs/startup_scripts/..."**
